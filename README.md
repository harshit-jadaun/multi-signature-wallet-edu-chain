📌 Project Title
Multi-Signature Wallet

📄 Project Description
A Multi-Signature Wallet is a smart contract-based wallet that requires multiple approvals (signatures) from a predefined set of owners to execute a transaction. This ensures greater security and trust in managing shared funds, especially in decentralized or organizational environments.

🎯 Project Vision
To provide a secure, transparent, and collaborative way of managing crypto assets by reducing the risks associated with single-point failures and enhancing consensus-driven fund management.

🌟 Key Features
Multiple Owners: Define a list of wallet owners upon deployment.

Customizable Confirmations: Set the number of required approvals for a transaction.

Transaction Lifecycle: Submit, confirm, execute, or revoke transactions.

Transparency: Full visibility into transaction history and confirmation status.

Security First: Only approved transactions can be executed, protecting against unauthorized spending.

🔭 Future Scope
User Interface (Frontend): Build a web-based UI for non-technical users.

Off-Chain Notifications: Integrate email/Telegram alerts for pending transactions.

Time Locks: Add scheduled transaction execution for time-sensitive operations.

Role Management: Introduce granular roles (e.g., proposer, approver).

Multi-Chain Support: Adapt for use on multiple blockchains beyond Ethereum.
